# Programming and setup for your MechKeys AVR-based board

Every MechKeys.ca board ships pre-programmed and ready to use.

To enhance the original layout on the board, download the pre-programmed layout from the board, modify it in the Boot Mapper Client, and upload it to the board.

In most cases, you will not need to upload new firmware to the board.

## tl;dr
* Get the bootmapper client, firmware, and extract both
* Plug your board in
* Run the bootmapper client
* Transfer the current layout from the board to the bootmapper client
* Pick the action you want in the "spreadsheet" list of available key actions
* Click the key on the keyboard rendering at the bottom to map the action to the key
* Rinse and repeat
* Enable the "reboot after uploading" checkbox
* Click upload


## Downloads
Download both the client and the firmware.
